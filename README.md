cd python-web-scraping
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

### To update the website

After modifying any notebook content, please run the `./compile.sh` script to update the website or alternatively :
- Run `jupyter nbconvert --output-dir='markdowns/' --to markdown notebooks/*.ipynb` from the root directory to generate the markdown files from jupyter notebooks, and
- Run `mkdocs build` to build the website again. 

### Troubleshooting

In case `wptools` throws an error during installation please install the following dependencies first :
```bash
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev  
```
and then proceed to install `wptools` though `pip install -r requirements.txt` as above.
